# 📘 Section 01 – Basic Python Programs

This folder contains solutions to basic Python problems from the Udemy course [Python Hand-on: Solve 200 Problems](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-handon/).

These beginner-friendly exercises help reinforce core Python concepts such as:
- Printing output
- Taking user input
- Basic arithmetic operations
- String manipulation
- Working with variables and data types

Each problem is implemented using Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and includes:
- Problem description (in a markdown cell)
- Solution code
- Console output
